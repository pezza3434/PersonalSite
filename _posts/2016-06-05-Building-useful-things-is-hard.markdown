description: A summary of where I am at the moment with eventcalendarapp.com and where I want to take it in the future.

<p class="lead">So it turns out, building useful things, and getting people to use them, is hard. Who’d have guessed eh?</p>

I recently released [eventcalendarapp.com](https://eventcalendarapp.com) and am currently writing semi-regular blogs on building a product and releasing it. The following is some thoughts on releasing a product and lessons learnt.

### What does it even mean to 'release'?

So what does it mean to release your product? I think it can be summed up as -‘Somehow letting some part of the public know that your product is ready for use and inviting them to use it’.

In the case of [EventCalendarApp](https://eventcalendarapp.com), our release consisted of setting up a twitter account and posting the app on ProductHunt.

I had marketing ideas for the future, but I knew that ProductHunt is a welcoming community and thought it would be a good place to get some initial feedback and maybe get a user or two on board.

### Response to the release

Very little. It got 45 upvotes on ProductHunt which resulted in around 12 signups which unfortunately did not convert to any paying customers.

It was also tweeted around a little on twitter which may have contributed to the signups and new followers on the app’s twitter account.

### Why such a little response?

ProductHunt goes crazy for things that are free. If you look at the [50 most upvoted products](https://www.producthunt.com/e/50-most-upvoted-products) a huge amount of these consist of free resources, or are in fact, collections of free resources.

My previous product I launched on Product Hunt, [Horu](http://horu.io) (a free product), got a much better reception and posting it on PH resulted in 100’s of signups.

Maybe then ProductHunt wasn’t the best place of this app.

It makes sense when I think about it. It’s unlikely that people on Product Hunt will be specifically looking for an Event Calendar, and if not, then the app really doesn’t have any value for them. There’s also not an awful lot they can play around with until they sign up.

### Steps moving forward

My number one aim right now is to get the app in front of people who may actually want it.

Sounds obvious right? But it’s much easier to avoid this and instead just post your app around all the popular sites such as Reddit, ProductHunt etc.

My first move towards this is integrating with Shoppify and getting on their app store. They already have an Event Calendar App, but it’s recently had some negative reviews and I believe I could do it better.

Further into the future I want to build more features into the app. I think the calendar is lacking a ‘grid view’ which I believe those who have more events will want. However, I’m trying not to constantly focus on building new features when at the moment I have no users on board.

### What are you working on?

That’s my position at the moment, it’s not exciting but I continue to try and move the needle forwards.

What are you working on? I’m always excited to hear what people who read this blog are building at the moment.

Thanks for reading!
