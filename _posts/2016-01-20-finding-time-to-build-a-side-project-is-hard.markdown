description: A look at why finding the time to build a side project can be so difficult and what you can do about it.
---

<p class="lead">This will vary person to person but these are the things that I am typically trying to fit into my daily life:</p>

**1) Work** – I work a full time job that takes up my 9am-5pm (ish) every working day.

**2) Personal Projects** – I continuously like to work on a side project. This can be either be to actually launch something like [horu](http://horu.io) or simply to mess around in a new technology.

**3) Career Progression** – I want to progress my career. This can involve either taking extra time to go over things I have not fully understood at work, reading books, or learning a new technology that we are introducing in the upcoming weeks/months at work.

**4) Family** – Super important. There should and will always be time in my life for family.

**5) Life** – By this I mean time to sometimes just let life just pass you by. There doesn’t always have to be a schedule for everything.

**6) Fun things** - This includes socialising with friends, going on holiday, going to the cinema, chilling out and watching TV for a while, doing some exercise, etc.

### What has and hasn't worked

Over the past 6-12 months I’ve really tried to boost my productivity. The following is some things I think have and haven’t worked.

I do my own work, before work. In other words, I wake up before work, usually giving myself at least an hour on the computer or notepad. This has been super effective and is probably one of my most productive hours of the day. The key to making use of this short time is knowing exactly what I’m going to do with it. I will almost always go to bed the night before knowing exactly what I'll' be working on the next morning, otherwise I will still be staring at the screen not knowing what to do.

The important point about waking up earlier is that it shouldn’t equal less sleep. Go to bed earlier if you want to get up. Less sleep is counter productive.

Make use of your ‘dead’ time. By ‘dead’ time I mean time that isn’t mentally taxing and you could also be doing something else. A perfect example of this is your commute to work. I spend 30-40 minutes each day commuting to work (I used to get the tram but now I walk); 5 days a week, that’s two and a half hours. Chances are you’re spending this time either staring out of the window, or listening to music. One of the best things I ever did was to fill this time with either podcasts or audio books. This is instantly ‘de-stressing’ because I now don’t feel like my commute is wasted time, which was incredibly frustrating before.

A particular technique I have found useful to be productive is the pomodoro technique. It’s super simple; you work in periods of 25 minutes, giving yourself a 5 minute rest in-between. Each one of these 25 minute periods counts as a pomodoro and must be super focused time spent on a task with no distractions. The good thing about this, for example, is that you can aim to do 8-10 pomodoros and know by the end of it that you have been productive. This removes the guilt about spending the rest of the day watching TV on the sofa.

In my experience this technique wouldn’t work well at work but works well at home on personal projects. I haven’t actually tried it at work but as a team we are constantly answering each others questions or helping to solve each others problems. We also ‘pair program’ a lot which would make this difficult. It’s much more difficult at work to be completely distraction free for an entire day. However, with my personal projects and when working from home it has helped a lot when trying to maintain focus.

Ultimately you need to find things that work for you and experiment. What I do, for example, will probably not directly be applicable to your circumstances, but you should be able to at least slightly adjust the ideas to fit them into your life.

I’m not 100% sure where I heard this from but I once heard that if you intend to do something and you do it then you are being productive. Therefore if you intend to watch Netflix all day and that’s exactly what you do then that’s fine! However, it’s the times when I’ve wanted to work on something and instead done something completely different is the times when I’m left disappointed.
