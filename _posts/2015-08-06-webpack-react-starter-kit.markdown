description: A react and webpack starter kit to get you up on your feet using the two technologies as quickly as possible.

<p class="lead">I’ve been tinkering around with react a lot recently and I’m impressed.</p> I’m yet to create anything substantial but it’s definitely something to watch out for in the coming months.

Someone recently posted on my Slack channel asking if there was a simple Yeoman generator for React. Now, I don’t know about Yeoman, but I created this [react – webpack starter](https://github.com/pezza3434/React-WebPack) kit while playing around with the technologies myself. I didn’t actually intend for other people to use it, however the person on Slack found it very useful, and so I thought I would share it on here.

The react-webpack starter kit contains the absolute bare minimum that you need to get started with React.js and the webpack module loader.  Simply clone the repo and run ‘npm run dev’. This also boots up the webpack dev server so any changes you make will be applied automatically.

Enjoy!!
