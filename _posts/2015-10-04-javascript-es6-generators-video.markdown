I was really pleased with the reception from a previous post about about [Javascript ES6 Generators](http://alexperry.io/javascript/2015/09/17/es6-generators-and-asynchronous-javascript.html).

I didn't mention it in the post but the video was actually based off a talk that I did at my workplace, Laterooms. Luckily, Andy Grant (a collegue of mine) was kind enough to record it and so I thought it would be nice to share it here too!

Enjoy!
