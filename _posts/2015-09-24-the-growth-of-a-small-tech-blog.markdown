description: How i've built a small tech blog from nothing to something worth while in just under a year. And why you should too!.
---

<p class="lead">I’ve had this blog for nearly a year now and so this seemed a good point to evaluate and see how things are going.</p>

I often get asked by friends and colleagues, why I blog, how much traffic do I get, what are the benefits of blogging etc – so I wanted to share all that with you.

Just over a year ago I had been thinking about starting a blog for a while; I knew that I wanted a personal site to showcase my skills, and so an accompanying blog seemed like an obvious choice.

Another major push for me to start a blog was [John Sonmez](http://simpleprogrammer.com/). I had been reading his content on ‘soft skills’ for developers and began to see the value in providing value for others. With that, I started to create the site you can see today and the rest is history!

### Some stats

Including this post I’ve written **12 posts** during the last year - one a month. From the beginning I wanted to write this amount at least, but intended to write more, unfortunately that hasn’t happened.

Having the time and putting in the effort to sit down and write is one of the main reasons I believe that most developers do not have a personal blog of their own. Increasing the amount that I blog is definitely something that I want to do moving forward.

### Traffic

Let’s dig in to some juicy stats….

Month by month here’s the amount of **sessions** analytics tells me I’ve had:

**November 2014:** 234 (Probably mostly me!)

**December 2014:** 593

**January 2015:** 398

**February 2015:** 306

**March 2015:** 1297

**April 2015:** 1050

**May 2015:** 3314

**June 2015:** 6000

**July 2015:** 5651

**August 2015:** 5634

**September 2015:** 5812 (as of 24th of the month)

This image shows nicely the sites growth. The dips are always the weekends. To my surprise, us developers are apparently much less active on the weekend!

### Most popular blog post

My most popular post by far has been [this](http://alexperry.io/node/2015/03/25/promises-in-node.html) post about promises. Much to my amazement, it somehow ranks on google on the first page if you search for ‘node promises’. This post alone has over 12,000 views to date! Interestingly, it was the second post I ever wrote.

### Traffic sources

What’s really nice is that over half the traffic comes straight from search engines. I’ve done some very basic SEO on the site but that’s about it

Another major source of traffic has been reddit. I post a lot of my blog posts on the appropriate subredit, usually [r/JavaScript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript) of course! Reddit comments can sometimes be brutally honest but that’s all part of the fun right?

### Some more benefits

Potential employers have mentioned that they have been impressed with my site. We’re very lucky as developers to have a job market in our favour – despite this I still believe it’s important to try and stand out from the crowd. I believe that having the site and blog would be a definite plus point if I ever decided to approach other employers. It also dramatically increases the chances of employers approaching you; this of course puts you in a much better negotiation position.

Another huge benefit for me has been the amount I learn by writing the posts in the first place. It has been confirmed by many around me that I can be a less than perfect listener, things certainly only really stick for me when I write them down. The research that often goes into each post alone is a learning experience and then to write this down really cements it in my brain. **Super useful when learning new things.**

Moving forward I would like to start building a mailing list; the idea here being to keep people who enjoy the content I put out coming back! It also means that they could become beta users for any side projects I decide to release.

### Some leaving words

I’m **super** glad I started this blog and would recommend it to anyone, not just developers. It has benefitted me in numerous ways. The enthusiasm seems to have worn off anyway; my girlfriend Vanessa [started hers a few months ago](https://vanessadyson9.wordpress.com/) – she also really enjoys it.

It really surprises me that more developers don’t keep active blogs. I work in a large company of many developers and none of those I know maintain a regular blog. I would really like to hear other people’s opinions on why that is. Is it the time factor? Do people think it’s a waste of time? I’m not sure.
