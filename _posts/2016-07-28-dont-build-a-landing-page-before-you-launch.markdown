description: An insight into why you shouldn't just build a landing page before you launch. Build something more.
---

<p class="lead">You’re a programmer, you’re good at making things and you’ve finally decided that you want to make something on your own.</p>

But you’re also smart, you’ve done some reading and heard that you should start promoting your product before you launch.   

Let’s talk about that.

### Promoting before launch

You will constantly read the advice that you should start promoting the day that your well-oiled keyboard fingers start punching out the codes.

What’s the easiest way to do this? Well, probably a simple landing page with an email sign up box. You can even use a pre-made template, easy!

The problem with such pages is precisely that, they are easy. And when something is easy, there’s millions of them everywhere.

[Tyler Tringas](https://twitter.com/tylertringas?lang=en-gb) sums it up pretty well in his book:

<blockquote>"…MVPs with a fancy landing page that then tell you “Great we’ll let you know when it’s actually ready” when you finish the sign up… I hate that. That was clever five years ago, before the Lean Startup became widely popular, but these days it is nothing more than an annoyance."</blockquote>

Something that has 100x more value is something that actually works, something that people can play with. Otherwise if it’s a physical product, a video of the product actually in action.

When I first created a landing page for [Event Calendar App](http://eventcalendarapp.com), the widget on the homepage looked very similar to what it does now, however I managed to build it in a weekend because **it wasn’t hooked up to any form of real data**.

The initial version was just a static page, but it was still a functional prototype.

Even if you just produce a basic prototype, you’re going to get 10x more feedback than you would with an email sign up form.  If you’re serious about the idea, this should be a small investment.

### The secret: You don’t even need to promote before launch

Although you probably should.

Sites like Product Hunt, Reddit and Betalist have made it possible for solo founders or small teams to thrust their product into the lime light, even though they have done no marketing before-hand.

But beware. Do not become ignorant to marketing because you think that sites like these are an easy alternative.

In my personal experience, launching products on Product Hunt is a bit like winning a TV talent contest– you’re super famous while you’re on the TV, but once that’s over it’s natural to just forget about you.

It’s also worth noting that it is much easier to get ‘upvotes’ on these sites if your product is free or has at least a free element to it.

Horu did much better from Product Hunt than Event Calendar App did. The site bought in 100+ free users for Horu but 0 paying customers or trials for Event Calendar App.

I haven’t tried Betalist and so I have no experience on that, however I have used Reddit a lot. I find Reddit the best for promoting Blog posts, while products such as Horu had little success on there.

**If you don’t start marketing before launch, at least start thinking about marketing tactics once you’ve got a working product.** It is much easier to market a product once it’s functional, because you’ve got something to show people.

Also, by building more than just a landing page, your demonstrating that you’re not just another ‘wantrepreneur’ and you’re serious about your product.

### The balance

If you’re used to the world of coding (like me), where logical code either works or fails it can be hugely difficult to get your head around marketing. However, there is one thing that is very easy to understand.

**Nobody. And I mean nobody. Is going to find your product unless you tell them that it exists and propose why they should use it.**

There is nothing more de-moralising than releasing a product and being confused as to why everyone doesn’t know about it and want it.

Be head-smart and realise that if you want people to use what you build you’re going to have to do more than just build it.

### The answer (disclaimer: In my opinion)

**Don't build a basic landing page before you launch.** Build something that people can use.

If you’re building software, try to at least give the user access to some sort of prototype. It doesn’t even have to work, just give the impression that it does.

If you’re building a physical product then show me a **real** video with a **real** product, even if it’s just a prototype.

### Now go and build!
