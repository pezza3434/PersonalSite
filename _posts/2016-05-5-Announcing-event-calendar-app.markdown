description: Announcing eventcalendarapp. An app to easily display your events.

<p class="lead">I’ve been building side projects since the day that I began programming.</p>

However, only more recently have I taken my side projects seriously and tried to build something useful, something that people will actually use.

### Horu

You may or may not know that just under 6 months ago I released an app called [Horu](http://alexperry.io/javascript/2015/11/15/Announcing-HORU-how-old-are-you.html).

I find it hard to say whether or not it was a success.

In many ways it was a success. It was moderately well received on product hunt (link) and even featured on their front page. This alone resulted in over 150+ signups and around 10,000 ‘ratings’ (on the app you rate peoples faces, guessing their age), in only a few days.

People seemed to enjoy using it, and people were continually signing up. All good then right?

Unfortunately, I was pouring **hundreds of hours** into the project for what seemed like very little gain.

As you may know yourself, once you get past the excitement of a new project, they become increasingly difficult to continue and complete. I wrote about this before (link), and this is probably a reason why most side projects don’t see the light of day.

I wanted to build something that had the potential to sustain itself (monetarily) and maybe even sustain me one day. Unfortunately I didn’t see that in the future of Horu and my motivation for the project soon disappeared.

**I decided to let it go**.

Don’t get me wrong, I completely understand that money isn’t everything, but it is incredibly difficult to spend so long on a project with almost no monetary opportunity in site.

### Back to the drawing board

I got back to the drawing board, and looked back at my other ideas.

I hear entrepreneurs talk about the fact that they build up a filter of what makes a good idea. Tyler Tringas recently spoke about this and related it to a [Meat Grinder](https://tylertringas.com/business-ideas-meat-grinder/).

After Horu, I had completely changed my Grinder.

I wanted to build something that people wanted, but also something that could be profitable from day one.  With Horu, I believe I only satisfied the first of these requirements.

### The lightbulb moment

My idea came when I was at my local Manchester orators meeting. I was checking their site to see when their events took place. What met me was a long list of dates with a warning that they were likely to change.

I could imagine in my head, someone logging into a Wordpress admin panel, adding all these dates, and having to log back in every time they changed. I also know that many companies don’t even want access to their own website and instead ask their developer to make changes for them when needed.

### Event Calendar App

I decided I would make displaying events on websites as simple as possible. [eventcalendarapp](http://eventcalendarapp.com/) was born. **It's not ready yet**, but is set for release very soon.

The idea is super simple. A widget that you can embed anywhere on your website that links to your Google, Outlook, or Apple calendar and displays your events in a simple and elegant way.

This means that managing the events on your site is as simple as adding or removing them to your calendar; something that you’re probably already doing anyway.

I believe the idea meets my first requirement of building something people want and crucially, it is something that I can charge for.

I love the SaaS (Software as a Service) model. It makes a lot of sense me. Good software takes constant maintenance; with reoccurring monthly revenue stream you are given the time to constantly improve the product and offer the products customers quality customer service.

I see other developers selling eBooks and info products. I considered this as I enjoy writing and have had successful ‘how-to’ blog posts in the past. There’s certainly a chance that I could make it work.

But ultimately, I enjoy writing software, and building things that other people use. I want to build something myself, not spend all my time teaching others how to build things.

I intend to keep you updated about my progress with [eventcalendarapp](http://eventcalendarapp.com), whether it’s success or failure that meets me ahead. At the very least, we can both learn something.
