description: Why finishing projects as a developer can be so difficult
---

<p class="lead">We recently had a "personality" test at work, which actually was very interesting.</p> We had to complete a 30 minute, multiple choice, questionaire and after attend a talk explaining different types of personalities. 

Long story short, we are all very different but can be roughly categorised into four different categories; two of which are outgoing (extrovert) and the other two of which are more conserved (introvert). I actually fell somewhere between the two extrovert categories which surprised me as I consider myself almost as much an introvert as I am an extrovert. 

What was interesting is that we were also given huge amounts of text explaining our personalities (i'm talking around 10 pages!). Now, i'm fully aware a lot of what was said was very broad and could apply to anyone (as a group we actually concluded that the text was fairly accurate), but one line stuck out to me in particular:

>
>"His life will be a series of initiated but unfinished projects"
> 

A lot of the text was very complimentary, but this stuck out to me in particularly negative way. 

I will happily admit that as a highly curious developer I have started lots of projects and either not finished them or lost interest. I would definitely say that talking to my peers it is apparent that they have suffered the same and lots of them have a graveyard of unfinished work; so why is this?

### We get bored easily

For me this is definitely a big one. I will complete the part of the project that I find interesting (for example the beginnings of a node backend), but when I know there's days worth of HTML to write after I can loose interest. (I don't mind writing HTML it's just not always the most interesting).

### We often work on the same project everyday at work and so want to try new things at home

Heard about webpack? React? Angular? Cordova? The list goes on. I've definitely started new projects before due to a certain technology that I want to try out, and then never seen it to the end.

###  Its hard to finish projects

Finishing projects is **hard**. Why do you think we have project managers at work. Some of us definitely need that person pushing us to the end.

I'm sure there are plenty more of these reasons and these are just a few. I'm determined to see at least one project through to the end this year; at the start of every week, I set myself goals that I want to achieve. This is working well for me at the moment.

So as developers, how do we ensure that when we set off with the best intentions to finish a project and release something, that we actually see it through to the end. I would love to hear any ideas.
