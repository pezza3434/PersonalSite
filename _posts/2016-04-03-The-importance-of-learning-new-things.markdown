<p class="lead">Today I was thinking about the importance of learning new things.</p>

The effect on your life that learning, even the very basics of a new skill, is astounding.

A very specific example of this for me was when I was around 14. I would say that I had an average interest in music, but certainly not enough that I would venture past listening to what was popular at the time.

I had just moved schools and was hanging round with a group of friends who all played the drums. Trying to be cool, I started to tinker but found that I actually loved it. I started taking lessons and had lessons for over a year.

It completely and utterly changed the way that I listen to music. I was suddenly noticing the intricacies of each song, the beat, the different instruments, and the different keys that each song was written in.

I later took up piano that exaggerated this effect even further.

But now, 10 years later, I think I forgot what it was like to really learn something that was completely new.

For probably over 5 years, I’ve been completely focused on being the best developer that I can; to the point where it consumes a huge part of my life outside of work, as well as in it.

Don’t get me wrong – I love what I do and I get to learn new things every day. New frameworks, new patterns, new language quirks – but when’s the last time you learnt something completely new, outside of the world of programming?

The answer for me - a long time ago.

I have no idea where it’s come from, but from the depths of somewhere has arrived a huge interest in photography.

I’ve spent the past two weeks learning about shutter speed, aperture, composition, ISO and what the heck the difference is between all the millions of lenses you can buy.

I’m a complete novice, I have relatively no idea what I’m doing, but it’s completely opened my eyes to a new appreciation of photography.

I find myself looking at photos thinking about the difficulties of the shot, how the photographer perfectly composed the mountains and the stream, or how they achieved that particular style.

The past two weeks have probably changed the way that I will look at photography forever. Even if after today I never decide to pick up a camera again.

…but so what.

What does it matter if I appreciate the melody of the piano in a song, or truly understand the skill behind that incredible mountain shot?

I’m not actually sure. I’m sure you could live your life either way.

But what I do know is how many people talk about the monotony of their daily lives, especially in relation to work. I occasionally get this ‘daily grind’ feeling myself – even if you love your job (which I do), the fact of simply going to work every day 9-5 can make it impossible to avoid.

Leaning something new can help to introduce huge changes in your life that can make things feel new and exciting again – it has certainly worked for me.

I challenge you to give it a try. Spend even a single day learning something new.

It’s hugely rewarding.
