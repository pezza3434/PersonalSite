                <div class="skill-box html" style="display:none">
                    As a front-end developer my HTML skills are 'top notch'!! On a day to day basis I use Twitter Bootstrap however I am more than capable of creating sites from scratch, such as this! I also have extensive experience creating responsive sites for tablet and mobile.
                </div>

                <div class="skill-box css" style="display:none">
                    CSS is another staple in my toolkit. I have experience in technologies such as LESS and SASS - enterprise sites can quickly get into a huge mess but these technologies definitely make things a lot easier.
                </div>

                <div class="skill-box javascript" style="display:none">
                    I'm a massive javascript fan and this is currently where I spend most of my time. I'm currently experimenting with Node.JS and all sorts of different technologies associated with it. On top of this, I believe my core JS skills are good.
                </div>

                <div class="skill-box jquery" style="display:none">
                    "jQuery powers the internet" - Yes it certainly seems that way sometimes. jQuery definitely has its uses however I try and see it as not the 'be all and end all' in javascript web development. Despite this I have significant experience with the jQuery framework.
                </div>

                <div class="skill-box angular" style="display:none">
                    I wasn't sure if this deserved a category of it's own but I couldn't resist. Love it or hate it I'm a huge fan. Since using this in my personal projects and on larger scale applications I've seen huge benefits in regards to readability of the code and scalability. I continue to build my angular knowledge on a daily basis.
                </div>

                <div class="skill-box php" style="display:none">
                    I seem to have used less PHP more recently however I have experience creating web applications in this language along with MySQL as the database layer. I've also used frameworks such as codeigniter and continue to improve my PHP knowledge whenever I can.
                </div>

                <div class="skill-box more" style="display:none">

                   As much as possible of my commercial work is backed-up up by tests including e2e tests and unit tests. This includes unit testing both the javscript and php while backing this up with e2e testing with the selenium framework.

            <h2>Who are you??</h2>

            <p>Welcome to my personal website! My name’s Alex Perry, pleasure to meet you. I’ve lived in a lot of places over the previous couple of years however I am currently settled in Staffordshire, a county in England.</p>

            <p>I studied Law at University and graduated with a 2:1. Despite this, I’ve always had a huge passion for programming, web development and even a tiny bit of design! During my studies I soon realised that even though I loved the study of law, a career in web was where I saw myself in the future.</p>

            <p>I’ve been freelancing since the age of around 16 (I’m 22 now), and spent a lot of time creating themes for the *Invision Power Board* software. I created and ran IPBSkinning.com which was highly successful during the boom of the forum system. One of my themes ‘Sylo’ is one of the most downloaded themes of all time for the platform.</p>

            <p>I soon moved on from this and onto creating sites for the WordPress platform however it soon gets boring creating theme after theme on a daily basis – and that led me to where I am today….</p>


            <h2>Where do you work?</h2>

            <p>I currently work as a front-end web developer at Codeweavers in Stafford. Without sounding too much like an advertisement, we create awesome web applications for the motor industry. This includes clients such as Ford, Bmw, Suzuki, and brand car dealerships all over the UK.</p>

            <p>Working at Codeweavers means I get to spend my days working with Html/Css/Javascript/PHP and other framework and technologies such as Angular.js. I have a huge thirst for knowledge and so I’m always eager to learn about the ‘next best thing’.</p>

            <h2>What are you up to at the moment?</h2>

            <p>At the moment I’m putting the finishing touches on this site, which I’ll probably never really finish, and working on a few side projects. At the moment, I don’t really have any public facing side projects as they are usually little spikes and learning exercises, however I have a couple of plans for the future. You can always look at my github to see what I’m up to.</p>
